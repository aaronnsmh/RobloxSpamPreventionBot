# Roblox Group Anti Spam Bot

## General

Designed to combat the growing number of Roblox bot accounts spamming on group walls.  
The only way to encourage your community to post on the group wall and keep them safe without lots of 
manual moderation is to use a bot to fight back.

None of the data scraped from the Roblox website is stored, it is simply read and forgotten.

The creator is not responsible for anything that goes wrong. Use at your own risk, edit at your own risk.  
I recommend using a throw away account, creating a bot role within your group with only delete permissions

DO NOT SHARE THIS FILE WITH ANYONE WHILE IT CONTAINS YOUR BOT'S PASSWORD

Supports both chrome or firefox, look at source code.

## Setup

This is intended for **Windows**  

There is code for both chrome & firefox but this is set up for chrome.
  
There are three requirements to run the code.

### 1: Python

Get the latest release here:
https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

### 2: Selenium Python Bindings

If you have pip the following line will work in cmd:  
*pip install selenium*
pip should be included with your install of Python

I recommend following 1.2 of this guide if you don't know what to do:
